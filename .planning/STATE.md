## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Fontsource for Geist fonts:** Used @fontsource-variable packages instead of official geist package (requires Next.js)
- **CSS-first Tailwind config:** Tailwind v4 uses @theme directive in CSS, no tailwind.config.js needed
- **Direct data copy:** Source files in coaching-intelligence-data/ were already well-structured ES modules
- **Citation format CALL-XXXX:** 4-digit zero-padded format for consistent parsing
