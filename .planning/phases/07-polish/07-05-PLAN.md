<objective>
Human verification of complete Phase 7 polish implementation.

Purpose: Validate all UX polish features work as designed before marking phase complete.
Output: Verification of all success criteria with user approval.

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 7 polish implementation:
1. Smooth modal animations (fade + scale on open/close)
2. Skeleton loader components (ManagerCardSkeleton, ChatMessageSkeleton)
3. Error boundary with graceful fallback (ChatErrorFallback)
4. MessageActions component with Copy and Add to 1:1 buttons (ASK-07)
5. Keyboard focus states on all interactive elements
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server: `npm run dev`

**1. Modal Animations:**
- Navigate to a manager detail page
- Click a citation link in the AI summary or ask a question that returns citations
- Verify citation modal opens with smooth fade+scale animation
- Close modal (click X or backdrop) - verify smooth fade out animation
- Open confirmation modal via action menu - same smooth animation

**2. Contextual Action Buttons (ASK-07):**
- Ask: "How is Sarah Chen doing as a coach?"
- Verify response shows "Copy" and "Add to 1:1" buttons below the message
- Click "Copy" - verify toast appears "Copied to clipboard"
- Click "Add to 1:1" - verify confirmation modal opens with topic prefilled
- Ask: "What's the average coaching score?" (no manager name)
- Verify only "Copy" button appears (no Add to 1:1)

**3. Error Handling:**
- Go to a manager detail page
- Enter an invalid API key (or clear the key and type "invalid")
- Ask a question
- Verify error message appears with retry option (not app crash)

**4. Keyboard Accessibility:**
- Refresh the page
- Use Tab key to navigate through the page
- Verify visible focus rings appear on:
  - Manager cards (on dashboard)
  - All buttons (bell, arrow, action menu items)
  - Input fields
  - Modal close buttons
- Press Enter on a focused manager card - verify navigation works

**5. Build Verification:**
- Run `npm run build` - verify no errors
- Check console for warnings
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all verifications pass, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Human approval confirms:
1. Modal animations smooth (not instant appear/disappear)
2. ASK-07 complete: contextual action buttons work
3. Error boundary catches failures gracefully
4. Keyboard navigation works throughout app
5. No console errors or build failures
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All four Phase 7 success criteria verified by human:
  1. Skeleton loaders appear during data loading and AI responses
  2. Error boundaries show graceful degradation when API fails
  3. Modal and card transitions use smooth animations
  4. All interactive elements are keyboard navigable with visible focus states
- User approves final polish implementation
</success_criteria>
